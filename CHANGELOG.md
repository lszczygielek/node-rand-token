# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2020-03-23
### Added
- TypeScript definitions matching v0.x module.
### Changed
- Added engines with min version of Node v10. Module continues to work on node versions going back to 0.8 but dev dependencies and tests require a modern version of Node.
### Breaking Changes
- None for core library vs v0.x but the type definitions and engines changes may cause compile errors.
